This is the same time-\nscale on which the atoms in the molecules vibrate, namely femtoseconds (1 fs = 10 -15 seconds).\nOnly recently have developments in laser technology enabled us to study such rapid\nprocesses, using ultra-short laser flashes. Professor Zewail\u2019s contributions have brought about\na revolution in chemistry, with consequences for many other fields of science, since this type of\ninvestigation allows us to understand and predict important processes.\nDevelopment of \u201cFemtochemistry\u201d rewarded\nWhen molecules undergo chemical reactions, their atoms move so fast that we\ncannot see it. But imagine that we could film the process with a high-speed camera\nand play it back in \u201cslow motion\u201d. Chemists\u2019 curiosity has prompted increasingly\nadvanced methods for studying even the smallest details of chemical reactions. The\nwork rewarded with this year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Chemistry has demonstrated how it is\npossible to follow atoms and molecules in \u201cslow motion\u201d during a chemical reaction\nin which chemical bonds are broken and new ones created.\nProfessor Zewail is using a technique that may be described as the world\u2019s fastest\ncamera. This uses laser flashes of such short duration that we are down to the time\nscale on which the reactions actually happen \u2013 femtoseconds. One femtosecond (fs)\nis 10\u201315  seconds, that is, 0,000000000000001seconds, which is to a second as a\nsecond is to 32 million years! This area of physical chemistry has been named\nfemtochemistry.\nFemtochemistry has enabled us to understand the underlying mechanisms why some\nchemical reactions occur but not others, and why reaction rates and yields are\ndependent on temperature. Inspired by Zewail\u2019s pioneering experiments some 10\nyears ago, scientists the world over are studying processes with femtosecond\nspectroscopy in gases, fluids and solids, on surfaces, in polymers and in biological\nsystems.

However, common\nto most reactions is that their velocity increases as temperature rises, i.e. when\nmolecular motion becomes more violent.\nFor this reason researchers already long ago assumed that a molecule first needs to\nbe \u201cactivated\u201d, kicked over a barrier so to speak, if it is to react. Expressed\ndifferently, when two molecules collide nothing normally happens, they just bounce\napart. But if the temperature is high enough the collision may be so violent that they\nreact with each other and new molecules form. Once a molecule has been given a\nsufficiently strong \u2018temperature kick\u2019 it reacts incredibly rapidly, whereupon chemical\nbonds break and new ones form.\nThe barrier is determined by the forces that hold the atoms together in the molecule\n(the chemical bonds), roughly like the gravitational barrier that a moon rocket from\nEarth must surmount before it is captured by the Moon\u2019s force-field. But until very\nrecently little was known about the molecule\u2019s path up over the barrier and what the\nmolecule really looks like when it is at the top, its \u2018transition state\u2019. The scientists\nunderstood this could be key information to understand a lot, from how life has arisen\nand evolved to how new drugs should be designed or how industrial processes\nshould be made harmless to the environment.\nHundred years of research\nSwedish physical chemist Svante Arrhenius (Nobel laureate in Chemistry 1903),\ninspired by Jacobus van\u2019t Hoff (the first Nobel Chemistry laureate, 1901), presented\nin 1889 the first clear description of how the rates of chemical reactions vary as\nfunction of temperature. His well known formula for the rate constant\u2019s temperature\ndependence:\nk = A e-Ea/kT\nhas been applied for more than a century by chemists and physicists. In this equation\nk in the exponent is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, T the temperature (in Kelvin) and Ea the\nso-called \u2018activation energy\u2019, i.e. the height of the barrier up to a hypothetical state\nas Arrhenius called it, the\u2018activated complex\u2019. Obviously the ratio between Ea and\nkT in the exponent is crucial (kT is a measure of the energy of temperature motions\naccording to Boltzmann, the founder of statistical mechanics) and we see how a high\ntemperature could compensate a high barrier.\nThe formula was given a more sophisticated interpretation in the 1930-ies when\nHenry Eyring and Michael Polanyi independently formulated \u2018transition-state\ntheory\u2019 based on dynamics in microscopic systems (single molecules) and presented\nan explicit expression for Arrhenius\u2019 pre-exponential factor A. One assumption made\nby the theory was that the transition state is passed extremely rapidly, on the time\nscale of molecular vibrations.

He had realised, from an\nexperiment in the 1970-ies on anthracene molecules at low temperature, that\nmolecules could be brought to vibrate in pace. \u2018Coherent preparation\u2019 of a sample\nsystem is thus a key point in all his experiments. We shall return to this concept.\nA new research field is born\nAt the end of the 1980s Zewail performed a series of experiments that were to lead\nto the birth of a new research field called femtochemistry. This could be described as\nusing a high-speed camera (the world\u2019s fastest!) to image molecules during the actual\ncourse of chemical reactions and trying to capture snap-shots of them just in the\ntransition state. The camera was based on new laser technology, with light flashes of\nsome tens of femtoseconds.\nThe time it takes for the atoms in a molecule to perform one vibration is typically 10-\n100 fs. That chemical reactions should take place on the same time scale as when the\natoms oscillate may be compared to two trapeze artists \u201creacting\u201d with each other on\nthe same time scale as that on which their trapezes swing back and forth.\nInspired by Zewail\u2019s experiments and exploiting his principles, scientists the world\nover study femtosecond-resolved processes in gases, liquids, solid materials, on\nsurfaces, in polymers and in biological systems. The applications range from studies\nof elementary reactions, i.e. the smallest steps in a chain of reactions, to molecular\ndynamics (how the molecules and atoms in them move). We can now address\nproblems such as the mechanisms for breaking and forming chemical bonds, and the\ntransferring of protons, electrons and energy within or between molecules.\nFemtosecond Spectroscopy has created a revolution because it makes it possible,\nfor the first time, to \u201csee\u201d in real time, and thus to understand and predict, what is\nreally happening in chemical reactions. That includes in principle almost anything:\nfrom the processes in the candle flame and the exploding dynamite to the most\ndelicate details of the life processes.\nTowards increasingly shorter times\nWhat would a TV broadcaste of a soccer game be without slow-motion\nphotography that afterwards shows the fastest and smallest movements of the\nplayers\u2019 legs and arms and the ball when a goal is scored? Similarly, the chemists\u2019\ncuriosity on what really happens during a chemical reaction has, over the years, led to\nincreasingly more sophisticated methods to improve time resolution.\nLight was early used to detect chemical processes: different substances have different\ncolours and using an instrument called a spectrophotometer and a watch one could\nfollow the transformation (kinetics) of different substances into each other. A major\nadvance was achieved in 1923 by two Englishmen, Hartridge and Roughton, who let\ntwo solutions arriving through separate tubes meet and be mixed, then letting the\nmixture flow swiftly through an outlet tube of glass. By looking into this tube at\ndifferent distances from the point of mixing, they could follow the reaction down to\ntimes as short as thousands of a second. Today a billion (1012) times better time\nresolution can be achieved by instead letting molecules of molecular beams in vacuum", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3238, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "756908ce-95fc-4440-9981-911d18350317": {"__data__": {"id_": "756908ce-95fc-4440-9981-911d18350317", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "PressRelease_advanced-chemistryprize1999.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/aayushmishra/Documents/Projects/Synth/v1.3/downloads/PressRelease_advanced-chemistryprize1999.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 239284, "creation_date": "2025-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "20ef3224-bc34-42cd-a412-9c047f4c1a39", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "PressRelease_advanced-chemistryprize1999.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/aayushmishra/Documents/Projects/Synth/v1.3/downloads/PressRelease_advanced-chemistryprize1999.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 239284, "creation_date": "2025-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-07"}, "hash": "c3e23b6b3166fabb6fa8127c59a1b4cea298392ccbcf7b81c80ea137df24f566", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "4\ncollide and use ultrashort laser flashes to look at the emerging beam of product\nmolecules.\nBut first, let us stop at another milestone. It was another two Englishmen, Ronald\nNorrish and George Porter, Nobel Laureates in Chemistry 1967, who improved time\nresolution by using a flash lamp so they could study molecules with millisecond to\nmicrosecond lifetimes. They shared the prize with a German scientist, Manfred Eigen,\nwho reached a similar time resolution by exposing his chemical solution to a pressure\nor electrical shock or a heat shock. Further some million times better resolution was\nlater achieved in studies of collisions between molecules in vacuum, work for which\nthe Americans Dudley Herschbach, Yuan Lee and John Polanyi were awarded the\nNobel Prize in Chemistry in 1986.\nWhat did the chemists see as time resolution was successively improved? The first\nsuccess was the discovery of substances formed along the way from the original\nreactant substances to the final products, substances termed intermediates. In the\nbeginning these intermediates were generally still comparatively stable. Each\nimprovement of the time resolution led to new links in a reaction chain in terms of\nincreasingly more unstable, i.e. short-lived, intermediates, being fitted into the puzzle\nof understanding how the reaction mechanism worked.\nThe contribution for which Ahmed Zewail is to receive the Nobel Prize means that\nwe have reached the end of the road: the times of the smallest reaction steps \u2013 no\nchemical reactions occur faster than this. We then no longer speak about reaction\nkinetics but of reaction dynamics. With femtosecond spectroscopy we can, for the\nfirst time, observe in \u2018slow motion\u2019 what really happens as the reaction barrier is\ncrossed and hence also understand the mechanistic background to Arrhenius\u2019\nformula for temperature dependence and to the formulae for which van\u2019t Hoff was\nawarded his Nobel Prize.\nFemtochemistry in practice\nTo achieve a \u201cmolecular movie\u201d of a chemical reaction, Zewail mixes the reactants in\nthe form of molecular beams in a vacuum chamber. In a simple case, a so-called\nunimolecular reaction step, it suffices with a molecular beam of one kind of\nsubstance. He then causes an ultrafast laser, which produces pulses lasting a few tens\nfs each, to inject two pulses onto the molecules: first a powerful pump pulse which\nexcites the molecule to a higher energy state and in this way starts the reaction. The\npump pulse is followed by a second (weaker) pulse, the probe pulse at a wavelength\nchosen to detect, e.g., the original molecule or an altered form of it. This pulse is\ntimed to arrive at precise intervals after the reaction has been started, to reveal how\nlong it takes for various molecular species to appear or vanish.

At the experimental conditions the reaction\nprobability is about 0.1, i.e. about one tenth of the vibrations lead to reactants.\nWhat Zewail and his coworkers found was that they could follow the activated\ncomplex as it moved back and forth between covalent and ionic structures (Figure\n1b) and, moreover, that bursts of free sodium atoms were produced in pace with\nthese oscillations. The explanation was that the pump pulse had created a sample of\nexcited molecules all starting at the point 2.8 \u00c5 and thereafter vibrating in synchrony.\nThen they will all pass the magic point 6.9 \u00c5 at the same time, explaining why they\nreacted almost at the same time and thus the oscillatory production of sodium atoms\nin the experiment.\nThis is the crucial point of Zewail\u2019s femtochemistry: to use a femtosecond pulse to, so\nto say, blow the whistle to start all the molecules at the same time and at the same\npoint of their vibration cycles. A consequence of the synchronisation of the molecules\n(\u201ccoherent preparation\u201d of the system), is that although the measurement by the later\nprobe pulse will include a huge number of molecules, typically millions, their\nbehaviour will not have blurred out but, thanks to the coherence, be like that of a\nclassical vibrator, like a vibrating spring. In turn this enables observation of the\nmovements of the nuclei during the vibration and thus a characterisation of the\ntransition state with high spatial resolution (about 0.1 \u00c5 in NaI).\nZewail also studied bimolecular reactions, such as the reaction between hydrogen\natoms and carbon dioxide: H + CO2 \u00ae CO + OH which occurs in the atmosphere\nand during combustion, and which he showed proceeding via a long-lived (1000 fs)\nintermediate molecule HOCO.\nA question that has occupied many chemists is why certain chemical bonds are more\nreactive than others and what happens if there are two equivalent bonds in a\nmolecule: will they break simultaneously or one at a time? In other words is it a one-\nstep or a two-step process? To answer such questions, Zewail and coworkers\nstudied the dissociation of tetrafluorodiiodoethane (C2I2F4) into tetrafluoroethylene\n(C2F4) and iodine atoms (I).\nThey discovered that the two C-I bonds, which appear equivalent in the original\nmolecule, break consecutively (the first bond cleavage takes 200 fs and the second\none takes 100 times as long).\nNever is research so important as when the results are unexpected. Zewail studied a\nseemingly simple reaction between benzene (a ring of six carbon atoms, C6H6) and\niodine (I2), a molecule consisting of two iodine atoms. When the two molecules come\nclose together they form a complex. The laser flash makes an electron from benzene\njump over to the iodine molecule, which then becomes negatively charged while\nbenzene becomes positively charged.

The bond between the two iodine atoms is stretched as the one closest to\nbenzene is attracted toward benzene, the other then goes off and flies away. All\nhappens within 750 fs. Zewail found however that this is not the only way in which\niodine atoms can be produced. Sometimes the electron fails and falls back onto\nbenzene. But this is beyond the point of no return as far as the iodine is concerned:\nlike a rubber band stretched to its limit and then breaks, the bond between them\nsnaps and the two iodine atoms are both flying off.\nCorrespondingly, in a recent study of the complex between diethyl sulphide and\niodine, Zewail shows that after charge separation induced by a fs puls, a back\nelectron transfer occurs in less than 150 fs, followed by the rupture of the I-I-bond\nwith the release of the first I-atom in 510 fs. The second I-atom is trapped for 800 fs\nand then departs. From the observed times, the angular distributions and the speeds\nof the emitted I-atoms, the detailed reaction pathway and the structures of the\ncomplexes may be deduced.\nThese experiments illustrate important aspects of electron transfer and both reveal\nmore complex reaction mechanisms than earlier anticipated.\nExplosion of research\nA much studied model reaction in organic chemistry is ring opening of cyclobutane to\nyield two ethylene molecules or the reverse, addition of two ethylenes to form\ncyclobutane. This reaction has been dealt with theoretically by two previous Nobel\nLaureates in chemistry, Woodward (Prize 1965) and Hoffmann (Prize 1981) and is\nconsidered a classic case of so-called concerted reactions. The reaction should thus\nproceed through one transition state as shown in Figure 2 to the left.\nHowever, alternatively it might proceed via the breaking of just one C-C bond and\nthe formation of an intermediate, tetramethylene (a so-called diradical having two\nfree unpaired electrons), which in turn has to pass a second transition state before\nyielding the final products (Figure 2, right hand side). Again we have the question: a\n(concerted) one-step mechanism or a two-step mechanism? And again the\nexperimental answer is not that of the simplest model: Zewail and coworkers\ndiscover that tetramethylene is indeed a possible intermediate, with a lifetime of 700\nfs.\nFigure 2.\nHow does cyclobutane dissociate into ethylene (or the reverse, how can\ncyclobutane form from two ethylene molecules) if thermally activated?

The right-hand figure shows the case\nwhere one bond at a time breaks, so that the reaction goes via an intermediate\n(tetramethylene diradical).\nAnother type of reaction studied with femtosecond spectroscopy is the light-induced\nconversion of a molecule from one structure to another, photoisomerisation. The\nconversion of the stilbene molecule, which includes two benzene rings, between the\ncis and trans forms was observed by Zewail and his coworkers.\nThey demonstrated that upon exciting the cis form (left) with a femtosecond pulse,\nthe central double bond of this ethylene-like molecule is weakened, allowing a\nrotation of both benzene rings (Bz) through 90o into a twisted intermediate form in\nabout 300 femtoseconds, to finally yield the 180o trans form (right). Such a coherent\ntwisting motion upon photo-excitation has also been observed by other researchers\nfor retinal, which is part of the pigment rhodopsin responsible for light detection in\nour eyes. The high rate of the reaction (200 fs), and the observation of a coherent\nvibration that continues to oscillate in the reaction product, could explain the high\nefficiency (70 %) of the reaction, a prerequisite for light-sensitive vision.\nAnother biologically important example where femtochemistry has explained efficient\nenergy conversion is in chlorophyll molecules, which capture light in photosynthesis.\nIn the mentioned examples energy economy is a crucial point, more specifically how\nthe energy is redistributed in an excited molecule. In a big molecule the energy can\ngenerally \u201cleak out\u201d through many vibrational channels. The indicated examples of\nhigh efficiency of photoisomerisation indicate that there is a mechanism to quickly\nlocalise the energy to some part in the molecule (to one specific double bond in\nstilbene and retinal).\nAnother interesting aspect of femtosecond studies is recently emerging experimental\nevidence for cases when an assumption behind earlier reaction theories, namely that\nthe energy added to a molecule will redistribute itself to equilibrium before anything\nelse happens, is not justified for short times. The energy-equilibrium assumption lies\nbehind the factor e-Ea/kT in Arrhenius\u2019 formula. Under such circumstances,\ntemperature is not defined and a theory that considers the explicit energy distribution\nin the molecule must instead be used.\nFemtosecond studies according to Zewail\u2019s concept are being performed intensely\nthe world over, using not only molecular beams but studying also processes on\nsurfaces and on clusters, e.g. to understand and improve catalysts, in liquids and", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2635, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92a47c54-0118-4c01-b84b-3d580481b079": {"__data__": {"id_": "92a47c54-0118-4c01-b84b-3d580481b079", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "PressRelease_advanced-chemistryprize1999.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/aayushmishra/Documents/Projects/Synth/v1.3/downloads/PressRelease_advanced-chemistryprize1999.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 239284, "creation_date": "2025-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dfb1fcaa-e6aa-40a9-9136-d51e1c64fe1c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "PressRelease_advanced-chemistryprize1999.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/aayushmishra/Documents/Projects/Synth/v1.3/downloads/PressRelease_advanced-chemistryprize1999.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 239284, "creation_date": "2025-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-07"}, "hash": "07b7870bfc6f3b258f431383f437957a89ad150585c9639a2cf5ccc90f1a25df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "10\nsolvents (to understand mechanisms of the dissolving of, and reactions between,\nchemical substances in solution) and in polymers (e.g. to develop new material for\nuse in electronics).
